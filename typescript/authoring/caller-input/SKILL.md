# Caller input

## Validate it, and fail with the right error

A published tool is an API: every caller reads its input schema and acts on its errors. Refuse a
bad value before the tool touches the site, and fail loudly whenever the run cannot return what
the caller asked for. Never return results computed without a value the caller supplied, except
an input that tailors the answer, which a read returns labeled with the value the site applied.

1. Express in the input schema everything it can hold, so the host refuses a bad value before
   the script runs: each field's type, an enum of the site's full set of options when the
   options are fixed, a minimum and maximum for numbers, counts and lengths, a format such as a
   date-only `CalendarDate` or a pattern for a code, and which fields are required.
2. Check every rule the schema cannot hold before any site action, and throw
   `new errors.InvalidInput(message, { field })` at once, starting "Caller input error:" and
   naming the field and the rule. Such rules include:
   - an end date on or after its start date, and a check-out after its check-in;
   - a date the task rules out, such as a departure before yesterday in UTC;
   - a count within the site's own limits, such as a party size or quantity the site caps,
     found while building and stated in the message;
   - inputs that exclude each other, such as a store and a ZIP code where the site takes one;
   - at least one of a set the tool needs one of, such as a record's number or its name.
3. Throw the error that matches what happened:
   - `InvalidInput`: the caller's value is wrong or the site does not offer it. It breaks a rule
     above, or is not among the options the page lists, such as a store missing from its
     picker. Pass `field`, and `available`, every option the page offers
     as selectable, exactly as shown, whenever the page lists them. The caller corrects the
     input and runs again.
   - `InputNotApplied`: the value is valid and the site offers it, but the page did not apply
     it after the tool's bounded retries. It ignored, reset or replaced the value, such as a
     filter, sort or date, and the read-back shows its own default or another
     value (core skill, "Configure, then read"). Throw
     `new errors.InputNotApplied(message, { field, requested, applied, step, siteMessage })`
     as the core skill says. A read, or a run that left the site untouched, may run again with
     the same request. Not this error: a number on a stepped scale set to the nearest step
     inside the caller's bound and returned as applied, a filter group the page disables
     reported as not offered, or a broader choice that covers the value (core and search
     skills).
   - An input that tailors the answer, such as a location, store or vehicle, that the site still
     won't apply, or a location it says it does not serve, on a read: not an error. Return what
     the site showed with the value it applied beside the caller's and the site's message (core
     skill, the input schema, "Inputs that tailor the answer").
   - An option the page lists but greys out, such as a booked date or a sold-out size, on a
     read: not an error. Return it unavailable, with the page's reason and alternatives, and the
     run succeeds. A write throws `InvalidInput` with `available` instead.
   - A write that declines the task because the caller's own limit or the page's state rules it
     out, such as a total over the caller's price limit, an item out of stock, a variant the
     page does not offer or a product number whose page names another item than the caller's:
     `InvalidInput`, thrown before the mark of the commit it guards (writes skill). Pass
     `field`, the input the caller would change, `kind`, the reason as a stable lowercase token
     such as `over_price_limit`, `out_of_stock`, `variant_unavailable` or `item_mismatch`, and
     `available` where the page lists choices, and give in the message the values the caller
     needs, such as the total the page shows beside the limit. That is a refusal: the run
     reports why, and that it changed nothing unless an earlier marked step ran, and the caller
     can run again with corrected input. It differs from a failure, a tool that broke, and from
     a write that may have changed the site and could not confirm it (both below). A write
     returns a refusal as its output only when its output schema declares that refusal, and
     only before its first mark (writes skill): any other output a write returns without
     `verified()` reports a possible change.
   - A write whose steps may have changed the site and then failed or could not confirm the
     change: let it end as a possible change, which is never retried. Never throw
     `InvalidInput` or `InputNotApplied` to make it look untouched (writes skill).
   - A control the tool could not find, open or read, or a page that changed: `OperationFailure`,
     never `InvalidInput` or `InputNotApplied`.

   Never pick another value for the caller, such as a near match, the page's default or the
   first option, and never report a refused or unapplied value in the output instead of
   throwing, such as a `sort_applied: false` flag or a "best-effort" description. The cases
   above that return results with what applied are the only exceptions.

## Ask the caller during a run

Try first. Ask only for what the page or the caller uniquely knows at that point:

- a choice whose options exist only once the run reaches them: the open seats of the
  flight the caller just chose, the delivery slots for the cart the run just filled, or
  which of the account's saved travelers, addresses or payment methods to use;
- whether to take a paid add-on within the tool's purpose that the page shows on the way to a
  commit when the input leaves it open, asked before the commit mark; a paid upsell outside the
  tool's purpose is declined, never asked (writes skill);
- which of several site entries the caller's value matches equally, such as a restaurant
  with several locations or a city with several airports, with those entries as the options.
  That is ambiguous, as is a near-miss name the site offers alternatives for: prefer not
  starting a refusal of either with "Caller input error:" (core skill). A day or option the
  page greys out, with or without a reason, is not ambiguous and never a question: it follows
  "Configure, then read" below;
- a code the site sends to confirm a protected action after sign-in, such as a confirmation code
  by text or email. A code that is part of signing in is the host's: a `code` field of the
  `authenticate` step, never a question;
- a fact only the caller has that the site now asks for.

Never ask for a value the request, the input or an earlier answer already supplied, a private
one included: use that value. Never undo an answer that declined something by doing it anyway
or by offering it as an input (core skill), except a paid add-on within the tool's purpose, the
payment method or the delivery address a write still meets on its path, which stays an input or
a declared question (writes skill). In the tool, take it from its input, or a private one, such as
part of an identity number, through a declared `secret` question, never a plain-text field.
When question review finds a question redundant, remove the ask and use the supplied value; a
reworded question still asks for it again. A placeholder that stands in for a redacted value,
such as "[redacted value]", supplies nothing. A supplied value the site rejects, or two that
conflict, can still need a question, one that names the actual problem.

Work the request already covers proceeds without a question, such as finding the right field
or choosing among alternatives the request already allows. A supplied value the site does not
offer is not such a question either, and never one to ask about, as .agents/core/SKILL.md says
("Configure, then read"). A value the page does not list at all throws `InvalidInput` with
`field` and `available`, the choices the page offers. An option the page lists but greys out,
such as a booked date or a sold-out size, whether or not it says why, is an answer on a read:
return it unavailable with the alternatives the page offers. A write throws `InvalidInput` with
`available`. Neither substitutes another value. Asking the
owner to revise it or stop is the minter's own `request_input` question while it builds, as
`AGENTS.md` says.

Use a published input instead whenever the value is stable and the caller can supply it
up front, such as a flight number, a date or a quantity. Never ask for a password, a
username or any other login: the host asks for a login itself and signs in. Never ask
for something the page shows, for permission to proceed with the operation the caller
already asked for, or to solve a CAPTCHA.

## Declare, read, ask

1. Declare every question the run may ask in the contract,
   `defineOperation({ name, input, output, questions }, ...)`, by id, with its `type`
   and a short `prompt`. The publication review reads these declarations once, so the
   prompt names the choice or value, never a private value. Write `questions` as a plain
   literal inside the entrypoint's own `defineOperation` call: during the build the host
   reads it from that source, not from the running script, and a computed or imported
   declaration declares nothing, so every question is refused as `Undeclared`. Each question
   the example asks is also reviewed before the build's owner sees it. An id starts with a
   lowercase letter and holds only lowercase letters, digits and underscores, up to 64
   characters (`page_title`, not `pageTitle`); the host refuses an invalid id before the
   script runs, and each `ask` uses the declared id exactly.
   - `{ type: "choice", prompt, allowOther? }`: one option; `allowOther` lets the caller
     type their own answer, returned as `{ other }` (a build's `request_input` always
     allows it, `AGENTS.md`). Own text that repeats exactly one
     offered option's label (or its listed form entry, `id (label)`) returns that option.
   - `{ type: "multi_choice", prompt, minSelections?, maxSelections? }`: several options,
     at least one unless `minSelections` says otherwise, at most the options offered.
   - `{ type: "text", prompt, maxLength? }`: free text.
   - `{ type: "confirm", prompt, followUp? }`: yes or no, returned as `{ confirmed }`.
   - `{ type: "secret", secretKind, prompt, maxLength? }`: a code the site sent to
     confirm an action after sign-in (`one_time_code`; a code that is part of signing
     in is a `code` field of the `authenticate` step, never a question), an
     authenticator code (`totp`, which a saved login's TOTP fills without asking) or
     other private text (`private_text`). It stays out of traces,
     logs and the minting model. A secret you ask during the build with `request_input`
     comes back to you as a handle such as `{{secret.s1}}`, which the host fills in only
     when your explore, test or `act` source runs live, and only where it is the whole
     string passed to `fill`, `type` or `pressSequentially` or a field of a request to this
     site (core skill); the published script never holds a handle and asks for the value
     with `ask` instead.
   - For a payment card the checkout requires, ask for every part its card form shows
     at once, in one request with one `secret` question for each part: `card_number`,
     `card_expiry`, `card_cvc` and `billing_postal_code`. Those handles go only into a
     card-fill step, never into source.
   - A published script asks for a card the same way: declare a `secret` question with
     a card `secretKind` for each part and ask them all in one `ask`, which returns a
     card handle for each, such as `{{card.c1}}`, never the card. Pass the handles to
     the context's `fillCard`, as in
     `await fillCard({ fields: [{ selector: "#cardNumber", handle: answer.card }] })`,
     with each field's own selector, even inside the payment processor's frame. The
     host types the card and clicks nothing, so submit the payment in a later call
     under the write's commit rules. Once you have the caller's card, and wherever source
     calls `fillCard`, no source reads a field's value or the page's markup, runs or
     plants code in the page, opens a DevTools session, takes an accessibility snapshot,
     screenshot or PDF of the page, records the page, or reads a request body, so delete
     such probes before you ask for the card.
2. For a choice, read the options in the execute call that reaches it and return them as
   plain JSON. Each option has a `value` the script acts on and a `label` the caller
   reads. Values are unique within a question. Offer only options the page will accept:
   skip taken seats, disabled slots and sold-out items. The value never leaves the run;
   the caller sees only the label.
3. Mark an option taken from the caller's own account (a saved traveler, address, card
   or account) with `accountSpecific: true` and a `maskedLabel` that keeps it
   recognizable without its numbers or email, such as `"Jane D. •••• 7890"`. The API
   and MCP show the masked label with a notice; only the owner's protected page shows
   the full label. A masked label that still shows five or more digits or an email
   address is replaced by the label's last four digits or a numbered placeholder.
4. Ask once for everything the step needs, between two execute calls:
   - `await ask("code")` returns that question's answer;
   - `await ask(["seat", "note"])` returns one answer per id;
   - `await ask({ seat: { options: seats }, code: {} })` passes a choice's options, and
     nothing for the other types.

   With an array or an object, `ask` returns one answer per question id, so read
   `answer.<id>`, as in `answer.seat`.
   For one question, `askOne("seat", { options })` returns that answer directly.
   One ask takes up to eight questions, with up to 50 options per choice. A choice
   returns the chosen `value`, a multi-choice an array of values. Write answers into
   the next call's code with `JSON.stringify`.

The run waits with its browser open and its active budget stopped, and the next call
starts on the same page. Continue from there. Do not reload, search again or repeat an
earlier step, and never resubmit anything the run already submitted. The wait can be
long, so in that next call confirm the page still shows the chosen option before acting
on it.

## When no answer comes

`ask` throws `ScriptInputFailure`:

- `NoResponse`: the caller did not answer within the request's window (at most ten
  minutes, less when the job's window ends sooner). The run fails as `no_response`. It
  is never retried or repaired, and its result says whether a step before the question
  may already have changed the site.
- `Unavailable`: the host could not put the question to the caller, or the answer did
  not fit the question.
- `Unauthorized`: the caller's access to the job was revoked while the run waited.
- `Undeclared` or `InvalidOptions`: the ask names an id that `questions` does not
  declare, gives a choice no options or duplicate values, gives options to another type,
  or offers fewer options than the selection bounds need.

Let these failures end the run. Never catch one to pick a default, the first option or
a guessed value. For a write, ask before its consequential step when the site allows
it, so an unanswered question leaves the site unchanged. A hold or a cart the run made
before the question is reported as a possible change when no answer comes.

## During a mint

A read build's example run, or a write build's `act` step, asks the build's owner
through the same request, and the answer comes back to the running script. Guardian
reviews each question first. When it asks for a rewording, nobody is asked, the `ask`
fails and the execution's result carries `scriptQuestion` with Guardian's rationale:
change the declared question as it says and execute again. If the owner does not answer
in time, the result carries `scriptQuestion` `unanswered` and the build goes on: decide
how to continue without the answer, as when your own `request_input` returns
`no_answer`. A write step that sent something before its question is reported as a
possible change; verify the site's current state before any further write. In a write
repair, or once the build is signed in or holds a login, an unanswered question still
ends the build as `no_response`. Do not turn an
account-specific choice into a published input to work around a question; a value the
caller can type, such as a member number, is a free-form input instead.

`references/caller-choice.ts` books a seat on the caller's chosen flight: it asks for a
seat and a saved traveler once the flight's seat map is shown, then books once and calls
`verified()` after reading the confirmation back.
`references/caller-code.ts` asks for the code the site sends to confirm an address
change and enters it on the same page.

## Standalone protected answers

Declare questions in the operation contract using the existing SDK schema and ask through `ask`. Ordinary answers are caller input, not extra authority. A `secret` answer is delivered privately for its declared purpose; during minting it returns an opaque handle. Use that handle only as a whole value at an authorized destination, never transformed, logged, returned, stored or read back. Website login credentials are requested only by the host during `authenticate`; TOTP/one-time codes are caller-supplied, with no stored seed automation.
