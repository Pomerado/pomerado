/**
 * One task setting a `mint_update` changes:

 * - `requirement`: a requirement, constraint or prerequisite of the task added, dropped or revised.
 * - `purpose`: what the finished tool is for, restated.
 * - `effect`: a read build becomes a write build. Nothing turns a write back into a read.
 * - `site`: the build moves to another site origin of the same product's workflow.
 * - `login`: the task now needs a sign-in, or a different login than the one it has.
 * - `output`: in maintenance only, one output field of the published tool's registered contract,
 *   by path, such as `price.amount` or `items[].currency`, with `text` saying the change as the
 *   caller reads it. `add` adds a field and `tighten` makes one stricter (optional or nullable to
 *   required, or a narrower type): callers keep everything they received, so neither needs
 *   anyone's confirmation. `optional`, `nullable` and `widen` loosen a field the site no longer
 *   shows as before, and `remove` drops one with a `reason` the host requires; the tool's owner
 *   confirms each of these.
