/**
 * A browser's autofill inspections and fills, which remember while this worker holds the browser
 * whether the host typed into its page: a refund, a corrected login or a relogin on that browser
 * never forgets it, nor does a field the page emptied after typing. A worker that
 * rejoins a browser its predecessor held cannot know what that one typed, so it starts as typed
 * (`typed`). Until something was typed,
 * each inspection's judged origins hold no typed value; from then on, an inspection may name only
 * those (`judgedBeforeTyping`) besides the site's and configured sign-in origins, since the page
 * may have put a typed value in any other, such as a form action's host.
