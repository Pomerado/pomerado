 * control and stops counting: a label that now holds the site's error text, or an id or name the
 * page generates on each render, such as `:r3:` or `mat-input-3`. The check then fails open, and
 * the indicator still decides. A read-only or disabled control, an unconfigured off-site frame, a
 * frame inside a hidden one, and a control or frame the host cannot read in time, such as one that
 * detaches during the check, do not count. It does not classify unrecorded controls or infer a
 * challenge from the page route. Callers must inspect and record each authentication screen
 * before checking completion. Another form's password field does not count unless a recorded
 * selector matches in it. Screens with no field leave any visible password field failing it.
