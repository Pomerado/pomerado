 * takes; the host checks every handle is a card answer's, finds each field in the frame that holds
 * it on the primary tab, refuses unless the page's top document is on the site and each field is
 * on the site or in a frame on an exact payment frame origin, has Guardian review the step and the
 * screen with handles only, then inserts each value natively into the field it bound. No value
 * ever enters page code, Guardian's input, the minter's context or the step's result, and the step
 * clicks nothing: the submit that books or buys is a later step under the write rules. A step that
 * names each field's card slot instead, with the checkout's total, is one a host fills from a
 * payment method the caller named (`fillVia`): core runs the same checks and review, then hands
 * the host the checked fields and reads no card value.
