/**
 * Page code: arms the guard on a filled field's own window for one submit call (`call`), and says
 * whether it guards that field. The page's own code runs while the host clicks, after the last
 * recheck, so the guard judges the submission as it fires.
 * - A field in the form the host's click submits, when that submission was judged GET
 *   (`submitGet`), is not guarded: it submits as judged. When the submit was
 *   judged in no form (`submitInForm` false), in whatever frame, the field's own form's judgment
 *   decides (`fieldGet`). A field in another form or another frame (`submit` null) than a submit in
 *   a form is guarded whatever the submit's method.
 * - It refuses a submission by GET from a form that holds a guarded field, or whose controls or
 *   entries carry a filled secret, and one to an action URL that carries a filled secret no action
 *   carried at inspection (`actions`, as the page kept them, never through the host; once the page
 *   was typed into before that inspection, only the site's and configured sign-in origins
 *   themselves, since page code may have put a typed value in any path or query). A password or recovery code is found inside any text
 *   (`match: "within"`); a code only where no digit adjoins it, nor a letter when the code has one
 *   (`"token"`), since a short one turns up inside a timestamp by chance. Both ignore case, since a
 *   URL's host is lowercased as it is parsed.
 * - A refused submit event is canceled. `form.submit()` fires no submit event, but its entry
 *   list's `formdata` event comes once the browser fixed the method and action; it cannot be
 *   canceled, so the guard stops the event, empties the entry list and takes the form out of the
 *   document until a later task, since a form not connected once its entry list is built cannot
 *   navigate.
 * One guard serves each window, under the host's random per-process `key` rather than a fixed
 * name. Its listeners stay for the document's life, and a new call disarms what an earlier one
 * armed there, so an earlier screen's judgment never refuses a later one's. DOM listeners work
 * from Patchright's isolated world as from the page's own, where a patched
 * `HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit` would not. The guard records only the refusal's method and
 * action origin, as found; the host names that origin only when no typed value can be in it.
