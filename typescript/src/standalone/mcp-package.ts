This integration runs on your computer as a local MCP stdio server. mcp.json holds its server
entry in the standard mcpServers format. The entry starts your Node with this directory's
launcher and your installed Pomerado runtime.

## Add it to your MCP client

- Claude Code

  \`\`\`sh
  claude mcp add ${deployment.name} -- ${command}
  \`\`\`

- Codex

  \`\`\`sh
  codex mcp add ${deployment.name} -- ${command}
  \`\`\`

- Gemini CLI

  \`\`\`sh
  gemini mcp add ${deployment.name} ${command}
  \`\`\`

- Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop and other clients that read an mcpServers JSON file take the
  entry from mcp.json.

## Model key

The server needs no model key. Guardian reviewed this integration when it was minted, so a call
runs it without another review and makes no model request. This directory and mcp.json hold no
key.

## Call it

Call ${deployment.name} with its discovered input schema. Each call opens the URL in
deployment.json. The authority there only sets the tool's read-only and destructive hints. A run
doesn't check authority, intent or sign-in origins, and edits to src/ or deployment.json aren't
reviewed.

A call that needs an answer or more time returns a job ID. Continue that job with get_job,
provide_input and cancel_job. Polling never resubmits an operation.

Answers sent through provide_input are visible to your MCP client and its model provider.
Restarting the server loses live jobs.

## Paths

The launcher uses your installed Pomerado runtime and local Chromium. The launcher source is
portable. mcp.json names your current Node and Pomerado installation. Update those paths if you
move either installation or this directory.
