   *   authorized origins every review reads, the browser's entry and sign-in origin, the
   *   publication site, and any private input, scheduling, quota or run-environment key bound to

   * - rerun intake screening and the duplicate check on the effective task, when it has them, and
   *   answer `refused` when either refuses;
   * - resolve the login the effective task needs (a new site, a read becoming a write that needs
   *   a sign-in, or a `login` change), answering `clarification_required` when the caller must
   *   supply or choose one first, such as when the account's one-login-per-site rule leaves no
   *   usable login for the new site;

   *   reviewed under write authority and the write build rules. The write session takes its own
   *   example claim: the harness calls `claimExample` again when its first act step starts, so
   *   the host must accept that claim even when a live read example already claimed one.
   * From then on every Guardian review of the build reads the effective task: the original intent
   * with `PendingExecution.taskUpdates` and the rebound `allowedOrigins`. The host never erases
   * recorded executions, claims, unresolved writes or Guardian decisions, and each recorded
   * execution keeps the task revision it ran under. It may refuse any update it cannot apply.
