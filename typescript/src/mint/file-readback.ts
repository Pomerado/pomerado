 * A file's bytes stay with the host: `files.place` sets a file input and `files.collect` keeps a

 * back would put its bytes in the result, and during a build in the model's context and traces,
 * so the host refuses such source before a live step runs and before it publishes.
 *
 * The check is a static scan of the source text, code strings included. In every build it
 * refuses setting a file input, a file chooser, saving a download and reading a file's contents
 * (`FileReader`, `readAs*`, `getAsFile`, object URLs, `createReadStream`). In a build that holds
 * a caller's file or uses the file API it also refuses taking a download outside the host,
 * `DataTransfer`, reading an input's files, `FormData`, request bodies and any request routing,
 * which could send the site's own upload, file included, elsewhere. It does not see property
 * names built at run time, a route set up through such a name, or a second fetch of a
 * download's address. Guardian's file-handle rule and its off-site rule are the backstop.
