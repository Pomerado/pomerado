/**
 * A card's digits stay with the host: a script's `fillCard` types the caller's card from its
 * handles, and the script never holds the card. Code that read a card field back after typing
 * would put the card in the result, the logs and, during a build, the model's context and traces,
 * so the host refuses source that could read a field back once a card is in play: before every
 * live step of a build that has the caller's card, and before a live step runs or a tool
 * publishes when some file calls `fillCard`.
 *
 * The check is a static scan of the authored files under src/, explore/, test/ and scratch/: of
 * every one Node could run, code strings and comments included, read with `\u`, `\x` and octal
 * escapes decoded, line continuations joined and a member named by a string literal
 * (`page["pdf"]`) read as a dotted one. It refuses reading a field's value or the page's markup, running code in
 * the page or planting it there, a DevTools session, an accessibility snapshot, a screenshot or
 * PDF of the page, recording the page, and reading a request body. It does not see a name built
 * at run time. Guardian's card rule is the backstop.
